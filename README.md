# eBay Lising WebScraper
This script, constructed using the BeautifulSoup3 library, outputs a variety of eBay listings into a notepad based on entered parameters, such as item, description, and max price.

I created this demo during my second semester of my first year college (Spring 2025) to show further my understanding of python, specifically its many libraries, as well as introducing myself to HTML code.
